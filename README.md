Though some of apps like Google people finder helps alot.
I have an idea similar to that app.
We could think of making an app which runs in background in any of the smart device. 
Connected to some forecasting site which predicts the calamity. 

Now when sensed a calamity forecoming could give some notification on its own and spread the text warning msg to all the contacts through whatsapp or any other such app.
At the time of calamity app could turn into a gps app in which people could upload their status how they are surviving where they are. Also the rescue camps could update the places where food shelter etc is available. Also donation using paytm could be used. 
Incase of floods or tsunamis cameras of mobilephones could automatically start recording and using image sensing technology if there is water observed could upload the same on map this will help people to know what areas are being affected and which are yet to be affected. We could use more of gps or mobile to mobile connections to attain this moto
